    "To prepare this project for local development, git clone it and create the conda (or mamba) environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "To initially create a conda environment for the project, run\n",
    "``` sh\n",
    "mamba env create -f env.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then install the project itself with:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sh\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Escaping Dependency Heck\n",
    "We've found conda/mamba to be the fastest, most reliable means of managing python dependencies. Pip just tends to fail. Poetry is a pain-in-the-behind when working with PyTorch, or any set of systems with different CUDA requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using conda's `env.yml` files allows us to declaratively manage dependencies, and sync them between different systems with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add new packages, you can `mamba install` it -- but it's better to install it declaratively by adding the package name to the env.yml file. There's even a section for packages that are only pip installable. \n",
    "After adding new dependencies to env.yml, run this to update the environment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "mamba env update -n autometric --file env.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## nbdev\n",
    "\n",
    "This proof-of-concept is literately programmed with [NBDev](nbdev.fast.ai). Each notebook implements one chunk of our pipeline, and is compiled into a python file in the `autometric` library. Many of these files can be run directly from the command line with arguments to, e.g. train a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "After modifying a notebook, run `nbdev_export` to overwrite the python files with changes from the notebooks.\n",
    "If you prefer, you can modify the python files and run `nbdev_sync` to propogate the changes back into the notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sh\n",
    "# activate conda environment\n",
    "$ conda activate autometric\n",
