*This is where the important code lives - the well-factored, unit-tested classes and functions that provide the core functionality of this library. This is their abode.

For documentation (and tests) for these code files, consult the docs folder.
For a history of how these were developed, including the experiments that led to their creation, consult the slipbox folder.
And for a neat academic presentation of the ideas encapsulated in this code and their import, see the paper folder.*
