abstract: |
  For a number of years now work has been proceeding in order to bring to perfection the crudely conceived idea of a machine that would not only supply inverse reactive current for use in unilateral phase detractors, but would also be capable of automatically synchronizing cardinal grammeters. Such a machine is the "Turbo-Encabulator."
plain-language-summary: |
  We introduce Diffusion Curvature, a fast, differentiable, noise-robust pointwise curvature for graphs and point clouds.
